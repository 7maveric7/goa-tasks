    <h2>Capybara</h2>
    <!-- ეს არის პირველი პარაგრაფი -->
    <p>The capybara[a] or greater capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) is a giant cavy rodent native to South America.
        It is the largest living rodent[2] and a member of the genus Hydrochoerus. The only other extant member is the
        lesser capybara (Hydrochoerus isthmius). Its close relatives include guinea pigs and rock cavies, and it is more
        distantly related to the agouti, the chinchilla, and the nutria. The capybara inhabits savannas and dense
        forests, and lives near bodies of water. It is a highly social species and can be found in groups as large as
        100 individuals, but usually live in groups of 10–20 individuals. The capybara is hunted for its meat and hide
        and also for grease from its thick fatty skin.[3]</p>

    <h3>Etymology</h3>
    <p>Its common name is derived from Tupi ka'apiûara, a complex agglutination of kaá (leaf) + píi (slender) + ú (eat)
        + ara (a suffix for agent nouns), meaning "one who eats slender leaves", or "grass-eater".[4] The genus name,
        hydrochoerus, comes from Greek ὕδωρ (hydor "water") and χοῖρος (choiros "pig, hog") and the species name,
        hydrochaeris, comes from Greek ὕδωρ (hydor "water") and χαίρω (chairo "feel happy, enjoy").[5][6]</p>

    <h3>Classification and phylogeny</h3>
    <p>The capybara and the lesser capybara both belong to the subfamily Hydrochoerinae along with the rock cavies. The
        living capybaras and their extinct relatives were previously classified in their own family Hydrochoeridae.[7]
        Since 2002, molecular phylogenetic studies have recognized a close relationship between Hydrochoerus and
        Kerodon, the rock cavies,[8] supporting placement of both genera in a subfamily of Caviidae.[5]

        Paleontological classifications previously used Hydrochoeridae for all capybaras, while using Hydrochoerinae for
        the living genus and its closest fossil relatives, such as Neochoerus,[9][10] but more recently have adopted the
        classification of Hydrochoerinae within Caviidae.[11] The taxonomy of fossil hydrochoerines is also in a state
        of flux. In recent years, the diversity of fossil hydrochoerines has been substantially reduced.[9][10] This is
        largely due to the recognition that capybara molar teeth show strong variation in shape over the life of an
        individual. In one instance, material once referred to four genera and seven species on the basis of differences
        in molar shape is now thought to represent differently aged individuals of a single species, Cardiatherium
        paranense.[9] Among fossil species, the name "capybara" can refer to the many</p>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Adult capybaras grow to 106 to 134 cm (3.48 to 4.40 ft) in length, stand 50 to 62 cm (20 to 24 in) tall at the
        withers, and typically weigh 35 to 66 kg (77 to 146 lb), with an average in the Venezuelan llanos of 48.9 kg
        (108 lb).[13][14][15] Females are slightly heavier than males. The top recorded weights are 91 kg (201 lb) for a
        wild female from Brazil and 73.5 kg (162 lb) for a wild male from Uruguay.[7][16] Also, an 81 kg individual was
        reported in São Paulo in 2001 or 2002.[17] The dental formula is
        1.0.1.3
        1.0.1.3
        . Capybaras have slightly webbed feet and vestigial tails.[7] Their hind legs are slightly longer than their
        forelegs; they have three toes on their rear feet and four toes on their front feet.[18] Their muzzles are
        blunt, with nostrils, and the eyes and ears are near the top of their heads.</p>
    <h3>Ecology</h3>
    <p>Capybaras are semiaquatic mammals[15] found throughout all countries of South America except Chile.[19] They live
        in densely forested areas near bodies of water, such as lakes, rivers, swamps, ponds, and marshes,[14] as well
        as flooded savannah and along rivers in the tropical rainforest. They are superb swimmers and can hold their
        breath underwater for up to five minutes at a time. Capybara have flourished in cattle ranches. They roam in
        home ranges averaging 10 hectares (25 acres) in high-density populations.[7]

        Many escapees from captivity can also be found in similar watery habitats around the world. Sightings are fairly
        common in Florida, although a breeding population has not yet been confirmed.[20] In 2011, one specimen was
        spotted on the Central Coast of California.[21] These escaped populations occur in areas where prehistoric
        capybaras inhabited; late Pleistocene capybaras inhabited Florida[22] and Hydrochoerus hesperotiganites in
        California and Hydrochoerus gaylordi in Grenada, and feral capybaras in North America may actually fill the
        ecological niche of the Pleistocene species.[23]</p>
    <h3>Diet and predation</h3>
    <p>Capybaras are herbivores, grazing mainly on grasses and aquatic plants,[14][24] as well as fruit and tree
        bark.[15] They are very selective feeders[25] and feed on the leaves of one species and disregard other species
        surrounding it. They eat a greater variety of plants during the dry season, as fewer plants are available. While
        they eat grass during the wet season, they have to switch to more abundant reeds during the dry season.[26]
        Plants that capybaras eat during the summer lose their nutritional value in the winter, so they are not consumed
        at that time.[25] The capybara's jaw hinge is not perpendicular, so they chew food by grinding back-and-forth
        rather than side-to-side.[27] Capybaras are autocoprophagous,[28] meaning they eat their own feces as a source
        of bacterial gut flora, to help digest the cellulose in the grass that forms their normal diet, and to extract
        the maximum protein and vitamins from their food. They also regurgitate food to masticate again, similar to
        cud-chewing by cattle.[28][29] Like other rodents, a capybara's front teeth grow continually to compensate for
        the constant wear from eating grasses;[19] their cheek teeth also grow continuously.[27]</p>

    <h2>Guinea pig</h2>
    <p>The guinea pig or domestic guinea pig (Cavia porcellus), also known as the cavy or domestic cavy (/ˈkeɪvi/
        KAY-vee), is a species of rodent belonging to the genus Cavia in the family Caviidae. Breeders tend to use the
        name "cavy" for the animal, but "guinea pig" is more commonly used in scientific and laboratory contexts.[1]
        Despite their name, guinea pigs are not native to Guinea, nor are they closely related to pigs. They originated
        in the Andes region of South America. Studies based on biochemistry and hybridization suggest they are
        domesticated animals that do not exist naturally in the wild, and are descendants of a closely related cavy
        species such as C. tschudii.[2][3] They were originally domesticated as livestock for a source of meat, and are
        still consumed in some parts of the world.</p>

    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>Cavia porcellus is not found naturally in the wild; it is likely descended from closely related species of
        cavies, such as C. aperea, C. fulgida, and C. tschudii, which are still commonly found in various regions of
        South America.[2] Studies from 2007 to 2010 applied molecular markers,[7][8] and studied the skull and skeletal
        morphology of current and mummified animals,[9] thereby revealing the ancestor to most likely be C. tschudii.
        Some species of cavy identified in the 20th century, such as C. anolaimae and C. guianae, may be domestic guinea
        pigs that have become feral by reintroduction into the wild.[10]</p>

    <h3>Characteristics</h3>
    <p>Guinea pigs are relatively large for rodents. In pet breeds, adults typically weigh between 700 and 1,200 g (1.5
        and 2.6 lb) and measure between 20 and 25 cm (8 and 10 in) in length.[31] Some livestock breeds weigh 3 kg (6.6
        lb) when full grown.[32] Pet breeds live an average of four to five years, but may live as long as eight
        years.[33] According to Guinness World Records, as of 2006, the longest-lived guinea pig was 14 years, 10
        months, and 2 weeks old.[34] Most guinea pigs have fur, but one laboratory breed adopted by some pet owners, the
        skinny pig, is a mostly furless breed. In contrast, several breeds have long-fur such as the Peruvian, the
        Silkie, and the Texel.</p>

    <h3>Behavior</h3>
    <p>Guinea pigs can learn complex paths to food, and can accurately remember a learned path for months. Their
        strongest problem-solving strategy is motion.[41] While guinea pigs can jump small obstacles, they cannot jump
        very high. Most of them are poor climbers, and are not particularly agile. They startle easily, and when they
        sense danger either freeze in place for long periods, or run for cover with rapid, darting motions.[12] Larger
        groups of startled guinea pigs "stampede", running in haphazard directions as a means of confusing
        predators.[42] When happily excited, guinea pigs may (often repeatedly) perform little hops in the air (a
        movement known as "popcorning"), analogous to the ferret's war dance[43] or rabbit happy hops (binkies). Guinea
        pigs are also good swimmers,[44] although they do not like being wet and infrequently need bathing.

        Like many rodents, guinea pigs sometimes participate in social grooming, and they regularly self-groom.[45] A
