    <p>Mosquitoes, the Culicidae, are a family of small flies consisting of 3,600 species. The word mosquito (formed by
        mosca and diminutive -ito)[2] is Spanish and Portuguese for little fly.[3] Mosquitoes have a slender segmented
        body, one pair of wings, three pairs of long hair-like legs, and specialized, highly elongated, piercing-sucking
        mouthparts. All mosquitoes drink nectar from flowers; females of some species have in addition adapted to drink
        blood. The group diversified during the Cretaceous period. Evolutionary biologists view mosquitoes as
        micropredators, small animals that parasitise larger ones by drinking their blood without immediately killing
        them. Medical parasitologists view mosquitoes instead as vectors of disease, carrying protozoan parasites or
        bacterial or viral pathogens from one host to another.</p>
