        On a high school field trip, a fourth-year student named Peter Parker visits a genetics laboratory with his
        friend, Harry Osborn, and his love interest, Mary Jane Watson. There, Peter is bitten by a genetically
        engineered spider, and falls ill upon returning home. Meanwhile, Harry's father, Norman Osborn, tries to secure
        an important military contract for Oscorp, the company he founded. He tests a performance-enhancing chemical on
        himself and goes insane, killing his assistant in the process.

        The next day, Peter develops spider-like abilities, including enhanced strength, senses, agility and speed, and
        the ability to cling to walls. Hoping to buy a car to impress Mary Jane, Peter wins an underground wrestling
        event, but is cheated out of his earnings. Soon after, his Uncle Ben is murdered. Peter pursues the culprit, who
        eventually falls from a window to his death. Meanwhile, a crazed Norman sabotages a product test by an Oscorp
