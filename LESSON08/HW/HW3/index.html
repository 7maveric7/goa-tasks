    <h1>Cocker Spaniel</h1>
    <p>Cocker Spaniels are dogs belonging to two breeds of the spaniel dog type: the American Cocker Spaniel and the
        English Cocker Spaniel, both of which are commonly called simply Cocker Spaniel in their countries of origin. In
        the early 20th century, Cocker Spaniels also included small hunting spaniels.

        Cocker Spaniels were originally bred as hunting dogs in the UK, with the term "cocker" deriving from their use
        to hunt the Eurasian woodcock. When the breed was brought to the United States, it was bred to a different
        standard, which enabled it to specialize in hunting the American woodcock. Further physical changes were bred
        into the cocker in the United States during the early part of the 20th century.

        Spaniels were first mentioned in the 14th century by Gaston III, Count of Foix in his work the Livre de Chasse.
        The "cocking" or "cocker spaniel" was a type of field or land spaniel in the 19th century. Prior to 1901, Cocker
        Spaniels were only separated from Field Spaniels and Springer Spaniels by weight. Two dogs are considered to be
        the foundation sires of both modern breeds, the English variety are descended from Ch. Obo, while the American
        breed descends from Obo's son, Ch. Obo II. In the United States, the English Cocker was recognized as separate
        from the native breed in 1946; in the UK, the American type was recognized as a separate breed in 1970. In
        addition, a second strain of English Cocker Spaniel, a working strain, is not bred to a standard, but to working
        ability. Both breeds share similar coat colors and health issues with a few exceptions.</p>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>While their origins are unknown, "spaynels" are mentioned in 14th-century writings.[1] They are commonly assumed
        to have originated in Spain, and Edward, 2nd Duke of York in his 15th-century work The Master of Game introduces
        them as "Another kind of hound there is that be called hounds for the hawk and spaniels, for their kind cometh
        from Spain, notwithstanding that there are many in other countries."[2] The Master of Game was mostly an English
        translation of an earlier 14th century Old French work by Gaston III of Foix-Béarn entitled Livre de Chasse.[3]

        In 1801, Sydenham Edwards wrote in Cynographia Britannica that the "Land Spaniel" is divided into two types: the
        hawking, springing/springer and the cocking/cocker spaniel.[4] The term "cocker" came from the dog's use in
        hunting woodcocks.[5] During the 19th century, a "cocker spaniel" was a type of small Field Spaniel; at the
        time, this term referred to a number of different spaniel hunting breeds, including the Norfolk Spaniel, Sussex
        Spaniel, and Clumber Spaniel. While no Sussex Cockers or Clumber Cockers existed, some dogs were known as Welsh
        Cockers and Devonshire Cockers.[6] The Welsh or Devonshire were considered cockers until 1903, when they were
        recognized by The Kennel Club as the</p>

    <h3>Modern breeds</h3>
    <p>The two breeds of cocker spaniel are the English Cocker Spaniel and the American Cocker Spaniel.[14] They were
        bred as gun dogs, to use their sense of smell to cover low areas near the handler to flush birds into the air to
        be shot, and to use their eyes and nose to locate the bird once downed, and then to retrieve the bird with a
        soft mouth. The major differences between the English and American varieties is that the American is smaller
        with a shorter back, a domed head, and a shorter muzzle, while the English variety is taller with a narrower
        head and chest.[14]

        Cocker Spaniel coats occur in a variety of colors, including black, liver, red, and golden in solids. Also,
        black and tan, and sometimes liver and tan are known, as well as a variety of color mixtures of those solid
        colors including roans, roan and tans, tricolors, and those solid colors with additional white markings.

        Rare colours can appear unexpectedly in certain lines, for instance while an all-white cocker is usually bred by
        selective breeding of very light golden strains, they can still appear very uncommonly to parents that are
        dark-colored. A noted occurrence of this happened in 1943, when a grandson of My Own Brucie, Best in Show at the
        Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show in 1940 and 1941, was born all-white.[15]</p>

    <h3>English Cocker Spaniel</h3>
    <p>Called simply Cocker Spaniel in the UK,[19] this is the breed that was originally recognized by The Kennel Club
        (KC) in 1892. The American Kennel Club (AKC) recognized the English Cocker Spaniel as a separate breed in
        1946.[14]

        The size of the English Cocker Spaniel according to the KC is 15.5–16.0 inches (39–41 cm) at the withers for
        males, and 15.0–15.5 inches (38–39 cm) for females. The weight of a show dog should be 28–32 pounds (13–15
        kg).[19]

        The English Cocker Spaniel is the most successful breed at the most popular dog show in the UK, Crufts, with
        seven best-in-show wins since the prize was first awarded in 1928.[20] This was mostly due to the success of dog
        breeder H.S. Lloyd's Ware Kennel, dogs of which won best-in-show on six occasions between 1930–1950.[21] They
        are the second most popular dog breed in the UK according to statistics released by the KC with 22,211
        registrations in 2009, beaten only by the Labrador Retriever with 40,943. In third place was the English
        Springer Spaniel with 12,700.[22] The English Cocker's popularity has increased steadily since 1999 in the
        United States when they were ranked 76th in registrations by the AKC, to 2009 when they were ranked 66th.[16]

        <h3>American Cocker Spaniel</h3>
    <p>American Cocker Spaniels were recognized by the AKC in 1878. Generally smaller than the English, separate classes
        were created for the two types in America in 1935 and the Cocker Spaniel Club of America discouraged breeding
        between the two types in 1938.[14] The American Cocker Spaniel was recognized as a separate breed by the KC in
        the UK in 1970. The American Cocker Spaniel is referred to as the Cocker Spaniel within the United States.[14]

        The American Cocker Spaniel was bred smaller, as American woodcocks are smaller than their European relatives,
        and the breed's appearance changed slightly during the first part of the 20th century, as the preference by
        American breeders was for a more stylish appearance.[7] The standard size according to the AKC is between 14.5
        and 15.5 inches (37 and 39 cm) at the withers for males and 13.5–14.5 inches (34–37 cm) for females.[23] The
        weight of the breed is typically between 24 and 30 pounds (11 and 14 kg).[24]

        At the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show, the most prestigious dog show in the United States,[25] the American
        Cocker Spaniel has won Best in Show on four occasions since its first award in 1907. The most successful breed
        is the Wire Fox Terrier with 13 wins.[26] The American Cocker Spaniel is judged in three separate breed classes
        under AKC rules; "black", "parti-color", and "any solid color other than black..." (ASCOB).[27]</p>
