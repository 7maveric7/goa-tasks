    <section>
        <h2 style="color: #137be4; font-size: 24px;">Introduction</h2>
        <p>Elephants are majestic creatures that have fascinated humans for centuries. Their sheer size, intelligence,
            and gentle nature make them one of the most beloved animals on the planet. I love elephants because of their
            incredible ability to form deep emotional bonds and their complex social structures, which are strikingly
            similar to those of humans.</p>

        <h2 style="color: #137be4; font-size: 24px;">Fun Facts</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Elephants are excellent swimmers:</b> Despite their size, elephants are surprisingly good swimmers! They can
                swim for long distances using their trunk as a snorkel to breathe while submerged</li>
            <li><b>They have incredible memories:</b> The phrase "an elephant never forgets" has some truth to it! Elephants
                have large brains, and their memories are exceptional. They can remember the locations of water sources
                and recognize other elephants and humans even after many years.
            </li>
            <li><b>Elephants communicate with low-frequency sounds:</b> Elephants can produce sounds called infrasound, which
                are so low that humans can't hear them. These sounds can travel several miles, allowing elephants to
                communicate over long distances.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 style="color: #137be4; font-size: 24px;">Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Elephants are not just the largest land animals, but they are also among the most intelligent and emotionally
            complex. Their ability to form strong bonds and their role in the ecosystems make them incredibly special
            creatures worthy of admiration and protection.</p>
