        <b>Sloths</b> are a <b>Neotropical</b> group of <i>xenarthran</i> mammals <em>xenarthran</em> the suborder
        Folivora, including the extant
        arboreal tree sloths and <mark>extinct</mark> terrestrial ground sloths. <small>Noted</small> for their slowness

        spend most of their <del>lives</del> hanging upside <ins>down</ins> in the trees of the <sub>tropical</sub>
        rainforests of South America and
        Central America. Sloths are <sup>considered</sup> to be most closely related to anteaters, together making up
        the
        xenarthran order Pilosa.

        There are six extant sloth species in two genera – Bradypus (three–toed sloths) and Choloepus (two–toed sloths).
        Despite this traditional naming, all sloths have three toes on each rear limb-- although two-toed sloths have
        only two digits on each forelimb.[3] The two groups of sloths are from different, distantly related families,
        and are thought to have evolved their morphology via parallel evolution from terrestrial ancestors. Besides the
        extant species, many species of ground sloths ranging up to the siz
