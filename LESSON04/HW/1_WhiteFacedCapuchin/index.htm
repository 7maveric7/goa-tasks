    <p>White-faced capuchin, or white headed capuchin, can refer to either of two species of gracile capuchin monkey:
    </p>
    <p>Cebus imitator, the Panamanian white-faced capuchin, also known as the Panamanian white-headed capuchin or
        Central American white-faced capuchin
        Cebus capucinus, the Colombian white-faced capuchin, also known as the Colombian white-headed capuchin</p>
    <p>C. imitator has a range in Central America, in Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panama.[1] The range of C.
        capucinus is primarily in South America, in western Colombia and northwest Ecuador, although its range extends
        into the easternmost portion of Panama.[1] C. c. curtus has a range restricted to Gorgona Island, while C. c.
        capucinus covers the remainder of the C. capucinus range.[1]</p>
