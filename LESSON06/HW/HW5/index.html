    <h1>Spider-Man</h1>
    <p>Spider-Man in film dates back to 1977, the rights belonging to Marvel until 1999, when Sony bought them for $7
        million.[1] He has been Marvel's most successful character in the cinema industry ever since. After selling the
        Spider-Man motion picture rights to Sony, Marvel eventually founded its own studio, developing the Marvel
        Cinematic Universe (MCU) based on the characters they still held the rights to. This would change in 2016, when
        Sony and Disney[2] entered an agreement to include Spider-Man in the MCU. Despite some disagreements pertaining
        to finances and merchandising between the two parties, the agreement proved a successful endeavor for both
        companies. The following two Avengers sequels, finally with Spider-Man, crossed the $2 billion mark at worldwide
        box office for the first time. Meanwhile, Sony in association with Marvel[3] launched the Sony's Spider-Man
        Universe (SSU), with Sony entering a 3 billion-dollar streaming agreement with Netflix and Disney.[4</p>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>The fictional character Spider-Man, a comic book superhero created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko and featured in
        Marvel Comics publications, has appeared as a main character in numerous theatrical and made-for-television
        films.

        The first four films were linked to television series and screened in theaters only in certain countries.
        Nicholas Hammond starred as Peter Parker / Spider-Man in the 1977 made-for-television film Spider-Man that
        spawned a broadcast series, and would appear as the character in two sequels edited from those episodes. In
        1978, the Toei Company created a theatrical spin-off of their Spider-Man television series, with Shinji Todō
        reprising his role as Takuya Yamashiro / Spider-Man. None of these films had a theatrical release in the United
        States.

        By 1999, Sony Pictures Entertainment had acquired the motion picture rights to the character for cinema and
        TV,[5] creating two Spider-Man animated TV series, and two film series comprising their own continuities: the
        Sam Raimi Spider-Man trilogy of films (2002–2007) starring Tobey Maguire as the character, and the Marc Webb
        Amazing Spider-Man films (2012–2014) starring Andrew Garfield in the role.
